## ðŸ“‹ WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED

### Phase M0-M6 (Previously Completed)
- [x] Project foundation and structure created
- [x] Flutter app architecture implemented

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE

### 1. Docker Configuration Fixed
**Files Modified**: 
- `Dockerfile` (moved to project root)
- `.dockerignore` (optimized build context)

**Key Changes**:
```dockerfile
FROM amazoncorretto:21-alpine AS builder
# Fixed Java image compatibility issues
```

### 2. Spring Boot Application Architecture
**Files Modified**:
- `ChimeraRailwayApplication.java` (main Railway app)
- `RankingService.java` (made repositories optional)
- `CacheService.java` (made Redis optional)
- `application-railway.yml` (disabled database auto-config)

**Key Changes**:
```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {
    DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class,
    HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration.class,
    RedisAutoConfiguration.class
})
@ComponentScan(excludeFilters = {
    @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, classes = {
        ChimeraMinimalApplication.class,
        ChimeraStandaloneApplication.class
    })
})
```

### 3. Repository Dependencies Made Optional
```java
@Autowired(required = false)
private AssetRankingRepository assetRankingRepository;
```

## ðŸš€ CURRENT WORKING FEATURES

### Live API Endpoints
**Base URL**: https://chimera-app-production.up.railway.app

1. **Home Page**: `GET /`
   - Status: âœ… Working
   - Shows: HTML page with app info and available APIs

2. **Health Check**: `GET /actuator/health` 
   - Status: âœ… Working
   - Returns: `{"status":"UP"}`

3. **Asset Rankings**: `POST /api/rank`
   - Status: âœ… Working with mock data
   - Example request:
   ```json
   {
     "amountInr": 100000,
     "horizonDays": 30,
     "riskPreference": "MODERATE",
     "maxResults": 5
   }
   ```

4. **Chat/Explanations**: `POST /api/chat`

## ðŸ”„ NEXT STEPS (To Continue From Here)

### Immediate Tasks
- [ ] Add environment variables in Railway Dashboard:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: [Your OpenAI API key]
  - `NEWS_API_KEY`: [Your News API key]

### Phase M8 - Validation & Calibration (Next Phase)
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL database service in Railway
- [ ] Enable real data ingestion (NSE/BSE, AMFI)
- [ ] Implement OpenAI integration for chat responses
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Performance validation and metrics

### Phase M9-M11 - Beta & Launch
- [ ] Flutter app integration with backend
- [ ] User testing and feedback
- [ ] Play Store preparation

## ðŸ›  TROUBLESHOOTING LOG

### Issues Resolved
1. **Docker Build Failure**: `openjdk:21-jre-slim: not found`
   - **Solution**: Changed to `amazoncorretto:21-alpine`

2. **App Startup Failure**: `AssetRankingRepository bean not found`
   - **Solution**: Added `@Autowired(required=false)` and null checks

3. **Ambiguous Mapping Error**: Multiple apps with same REST endpoints
   - **Solution**: Used `@ComponentScan` filters to exclude conflicting classes

4. **Railway Port Configuration**: App needs listening port
   - **Solution**: Use port `8080` (current Spring Boot default)

## ðŸ”„ HOW TO START A NEW SESSION WITH CLAUDE

### Required Prompt for New Sessions:
```
Hi Claude! I'm continuing work on my Chimera MVP project. Please read the session-progress-log.md file I'm attaching to understand everything we've accomplished so far. 

Current status: Railway deployment is working at https://chimera-app-production.up.railway.app

I want to continue from where we left off. The next steps are to add environment variables to Railway and then move to Phase M8 (Validation & Calibration).

Please read the progress log and let me know you understand our current status, then help me with the next steps.
```

3. **backend/src/main/java/com/chimera/ChimeraRailwayApplication.java** (if working on backend)
4. **Any specific files** you want to modify

### What Claude Should Do:
1. Read the progress log to understand current status
2. Acknowledge what's been completed (Phase M7)
3. Confirm Railway deployment is working
4. Help with immediate next steps (environment variables)
5. Continue with Phase M8 or whatever you specify
