## Executive Summary

Phase M3 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive feature engineering, transparent scoring, and calibration framework. All core components are in place with proper documentation and validation.

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Feature Engineering Framework ✅
- **Multi-horizon returns calculation**: 1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y periods
- **EWMA volatility calculation**: Using λ=0.94 (RiskMetrics standard)
- **Momentum indicators**: 12-1, 6-1, 3-1 month momentum with reversal signals  
- **Risk metrics**: Maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, downside volatility, beta
- **Liquidity features**: Volume z-score, liquidity ratio, market impact estimation
- **Sentiment integration**: News-based sentiment scoring with recency weighting

### 2. Transparent Scoring Formula ✅
**Implemented scoring equation:**
```
Score_i = w_r × z(μ̂_i) - w_σ × z(σ̂_i) - w_d × z(DD_i) + w_l × z(liq_i) + w_s × z(sent_i) + w_e × z(ESG_i)
```

**Horizon-specific weight presets:**
- **Short-term (1-6M)**: Return=35%, Vol=20%, DD=15%, Liq=15%, Sent=15%, Quality=0%  
- **Medium-term (6-18M)**: Return=25%, Vol=25%, DD=20%, Liq=10%, Sent=10%, Quality=10%
- **Long-term (18M+)**: Return=15%, Vol=20%, DD=25%, Liq=5%, Sent=5%, Quality=30%

### 3. Calibration Framework ✅
- **Isotonic regression calibration**: Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm (PAVA)
- **Time-series cross-validation**: Purged walk-forward with embargo gaps
